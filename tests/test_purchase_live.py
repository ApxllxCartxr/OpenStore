"""A whole purchase against the **running demo**, over HTTP, like an agent.

Everything here was green as unit tests while the running system could not take
an order at all: the tool surface answered `accepted: true`, the approve page
posted to a route that did not exist, and nothing ever called the Gate. So this
suite does not import the money path — it *uses* it, through the same URLs an
agent and a Consumer would.

Skipped unless `OPENSTORE_LIVE_ORIGIN` points at a running stack, so the default
suite stays hermetic:
