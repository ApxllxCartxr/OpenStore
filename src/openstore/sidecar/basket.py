"""The basket, which lives here and not in the agent.

An agent that keeps its own basket has two baskets and shows the wrong one. The
lines, the Destination, the Contact Point and the chosen fulfillment all live in
the sidecar; a chat's cart operations are calls, not local state (SPEC §11).

**Nothing here prices anything.** A total comes from door 9 or it does not
exist — the Merchant is truth, and a basket that could add up its own lines
would eventually disagree with the shop about what a Consumer owes.
