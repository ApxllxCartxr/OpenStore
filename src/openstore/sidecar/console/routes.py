"""`/agentic` routes, and the auth boundary that is part of the contract.

**Two paths inside this prefix are public on purpose** (A8's table):

- `/agentic/approve` is authenticated by the **one-time tap token**, not by the
  Merchant session. A Consumer approving a spend is not the Merchant and must
  never need the Merchant's login.
- `/receipt/<id>` (mounted in `app.py`) is public entirely.

That is exactly the kind of thing a proxy config gets wrong once and then serves
wrong forever, so it is asserted by tests here rather than left to the
`Caddyfile`.
