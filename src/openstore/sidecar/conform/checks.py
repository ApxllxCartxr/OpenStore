"""The checks, and what each one is actually claiming.

**Nothing here hardcodes a SKU.** The suite reads door 1 and picks its own
subjects: the first item with stock to spare, a Product Group to offer where a
SKU belongs, an Add-on if the store has one. A fixed SKU would pass against the
store it was written for and fail against every other, which is the opposite of
a conformance suite.

**The store is written to, and says so.** Orders are created, stock is held and
released. Every check cleans up after itself — a hold this suite takes is a hold
it gives back, because a conformance run that quietly consumed a shop's
inventory would be the last one anybody let near a real store. `--read-only`
runs the subset that writes nothing, which is the right first pass against
production.
