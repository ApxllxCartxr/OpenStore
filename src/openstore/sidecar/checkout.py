"""The money path, and the one HTTP entry point into it.

Everything below already existed and was exercised only by tests: the Gate ran
its twelve checks, the Ledger kept its two invariants, `settle` resolved a
deferred Authority, `BundleBuilder` sealed a receipt and the verifier checked
it. Nothing in `src/` ever called any of it, so the sidecar could not take an
order at all — the agent surface answered every tool `accepted: true` and the
approve page posted to a route that did not exist.

This module is the wiring, and nothing more. It computes no price, invents no
status, and makes no decision the Gate has not already made.

**The sequence** (SPEC §6.5's call order, one HTTP request per step):

1. `start` — door 7 creates the order (`pending`, no stock held), door 9 quotes
   it, and the two together fix the `cart_hash`. A tap token is minted over that
   exact hash and total. Nothing has moved.
2. `tap` — the Consumer approves on the Merchant's own origin. The token is
   spent once, the Gate runs for real, door 3 holds the stock, the Ledger takes
   the hold, and the Provider issues a link.
3. `complete` — the money arrives. `settle` reconciles it, door 4 commits the
   stock, the order becomes `paid`, and the receipt is sealed and stored.

**`order_salt` is never held between requests** (§6.3a). Door 7 is idempotent on
`cart_id:attempt`, so each step that needs the salt re-reads it from the
Merchant by replaying that call, uses it in request memory, and drops it. Caching
it here would be the quiet way to break ADR-0011's erasure guarantee: erasing an
order would stop making its PII commitments unopenable, which is the whole point
of them.
