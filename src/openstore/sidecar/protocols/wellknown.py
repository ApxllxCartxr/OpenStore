"""The cards a stranger reads before it knows anything about this shop.

Three documents, all public and unauthenticated by design:

- `/.well-known/agent-commerce.json` — who this Merchant is, what protocols the
  sidecar speaks, where the agent endpoints are, and **what it refuses**.
- `/.well-known/ucp.json` — the UCP manifest.
- `/.well-known/jwks.json` — the Merchant's signing keys, so a receipt can be
  verified by anyone holding it.

Public is the point. A card behind authentication is a card no new agent can
read, and the whole admission story (ADR-0012) starts with a stranger fetching
one without asking permission first.

**The card states the refusals inline.** An agent that reads it knows before it
starts that there is no delegated-credential path here and that every spend
terminates in a human tap — which is kinder than finding out at the last step.
