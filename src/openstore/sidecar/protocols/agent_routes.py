"""`/agent/*` — the public front door, and the `.well-known` cards beside it.

Every route here is reachable by a stranger, because that is the design
(ADR-0012). What makes it safe is not who can knock:

- Rate limits per agent tier **and** per IP on every route (§16.8).
- RFC 9421 signatures on everything a self-registered agent sends.
- Scope checks before any body runs.
- And the Gate, which refuses a spend without a fresh Authority no matter which
  door the agent came through.

**`place-order` returns an approve URL, never an order.** That is the single
most load-bearing sentence on this surface.
