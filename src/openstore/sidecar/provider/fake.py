"""The demo Provider. Declares every method, moves no real money.

`make_link` returns a link to a local page with Approve and Decline; Approve
fires a correctly-HMAC'd webhook after a short delay, Decline fires a failure
webhook immediately (§16.10). Link lifetime is 15 minutes, matching §16.7's
`confirmed` payment window — the sidecar releases at the link's own expiry and
never later than the Provider's lifetime, so those two numbers must agree.

It is the demo default, and CI runs it. It is not a mock: the same webhook
verification, the same reconcile, the same adoption path.
