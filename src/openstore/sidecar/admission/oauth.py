"""Two admission routes, one authority.

An allowlisted agent uses Merchant-issued OAuth client credentials; a stranger
self-registers by publishing an Agent Profile and signing every request against
it (ADR-0012). Both get the same four scopes and the same short expiry.

**No tier unlocks money.** `confirm` without a fresh accepted Authority is
refused by the Gate regardless of which door the agent came through. Reputation
buys throughput only — an allowlisted agent gets a higher rate limit and not one
capability more.
